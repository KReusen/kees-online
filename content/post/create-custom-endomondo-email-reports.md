Since the year 2010 I’ve used the app Endomondo to track all of my (462) runs. To improve my odds of  succeeding at my personal challenge of running 1 kilometer every weekday (or pay 500 euros to my anti charity), I decided to create a motivating weekly report that gets sent to my email every Sunday.

Unfortunately, with Endomondo not providing a public API, this wasn’t as easy as it could have been. I got creative and found another way to access the activity data. If you follow the steps in this article, you too will be able to create reports like the one below. No technical background required!
