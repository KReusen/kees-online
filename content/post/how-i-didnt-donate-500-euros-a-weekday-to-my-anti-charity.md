I love how sports make me feel. Every time I do some, I end up energized and happy. Even with this in mind, I used to fail miserably in actually doing sports. Making time to do them, with distractions like Netflix in reach, often seemed to require more will power than I could provide. And even when I did make the time, I found it very hard to actually step outside into the cold to start running. Strange, because I know I enjoy going for a jog!

It took many tries and many years to overcome this strange gap between what I knew I liked doing but what I didn’t like starting. As of this year I finally found a way to keep myself motivated. And it works: I have been running for the last 28 weekdays in a row and lost 6.6 kilograms in the process. I’m eager to share my strategy with you so you may benefit from it as well!
